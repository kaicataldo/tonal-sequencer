# react-minimal-starter-kit

This is a minimal starter kit for anyone interested in playing around with React - no additional setup necessary!

## About

The goal for this project is to make it as easy as possible for anyone to hit the ground running, allowing them to start writing code immediately, looking at configuration and tooling as they get more comfortable. The author's desire to keep this simple and minimal comes from wanting to make the setup as light and unopinionated as possible and the hope that, for those unfamiliar, the tooling configuration is both readable and easy to understand.

This project is not intended for production use, though it could be the base for such a project.
